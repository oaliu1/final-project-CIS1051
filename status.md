Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have installed open cv and media pipe and got the video screen to pop up once my code is ran. I've also got the hand landmarks to appear on my hands when I show them to the camera.


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to upload my images into techable machine so that it will train my computer to recognize the different signs and print its prediciton live onto the video screen. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The main problem that I have encountered was installing the libraries I needed for my project and figuring out what version of python would be compatible with all the libraries that I needed. Another problem I faced was implemnting the hand detection class into my main class, and learning how to use open cv and mediapipe.
